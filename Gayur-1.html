			<h2>Competitors.</h2>
			<p>The construction system market began to take shape quite a long time ago. Since then, some of the first companies have proven their high professional status in practice, some enterprises, unable to withstand the competition, have collapsed. Although if the company is on the market not so long ago, it does not mean bad. New businesses are less conservative, open to new technologies and new ideas.</p>

			<p>As it became clear, the level of competition in this field of activity is very high, and therefore it is very difficult for a young company to stay afloat when large organizations that have already proven themselves for 10-15 years offer their services in this industry. In such conditions, it is necessary to debug corporate work in a team, work professionally with clients, make competent advertising, and create an active policy of entering the market.In business, as in love and war, all means are good, as long as it does not go against the law, of course. For DOOO "Gayur-1", the main competitor in the field of construction is those who have good experience. Which has been in the construction market for a long time, and has established itself as an enterprise with excellent quality and excellent reputation.</p>
